## API Endpoints

### Create Short URL

Create a new short URL using the POST method.

```request
POST /shorten
{
  "url": "https://www.example.com/some/long/url"
}
```

The endpoint should validate the request body and return a 201 Created status code with the newly created short URL i.e.

```response
{
  "id": "1",
  "url": "https://www.example.com/some/long/url",
  "shortCode": "abc123",
  "createdAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

or a `400 Bad Request` status code with error messages in case of validation errors. Short codes must be unique and should be generated randomly.

### Retrieve Original URL

Retrieve the original URL from a short URL using the GET method.

```request
GET /shorten/abc123
```

The endpoint should return a 200 OK status code with the original URL i.e.

```response
{
  "id": "1",
  "url": "https://www.example.com/some/long/url",
  "shortCode": "abc123",
  "createdAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

or a ``404 Not Found`` status code if the short URL was not found. Your frontend should be responsible for retrieving the original URL using the short URL and redirecting the user to the original URL.

### Update Short URL

Update an existing short URL using the PUT method.

```request
PUT /shorten/abc123
{
  "url": "https://www.example.com/some/updated/url"
}
```

The endpoint should validate the request body and return a 200 OK status code with the updated short URL i.e.

```response
{
  "id": "1",
  "url": "https://www.example.com/some/updated/url",
  "shortCode": "abc123",
  "createdAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2021-09-01T12:30:00Z"
}
```

or a `400 Bad Request` status code with error messages in case of validation errors. It should return a `404 Not Found` status code if the short URL was not found.

### Delete Short URL

Delete an existing short URL using the DELETE method

```request
DELETE /shorten/abc123
```

The endpoint should return a `204 No Content` status code if the short URL was successfully deleted or a `404 Not Found` status code if the short URL was not found.

### Get URL Statistics

Get statistics for a short URL using the GET method.

```request
GET /shorten/abc123/stats
```

The endpoint should return a 200 OK status code with the statistics i.e.

```response
{
  "id": "1",
  "url": "https://www.example.com/some/long/url",
  "shortCode": "abc123",
  "createdAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z",
